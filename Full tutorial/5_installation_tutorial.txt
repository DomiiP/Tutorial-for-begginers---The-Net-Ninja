 The node package helps perfom certain type of text
 Express - Helps with routing and templating
 Node Package Manager - publish, download packages.. (npm)

 We can install express with 'npm install express'
 We can uninstall with 'npm uninstall express'
 Both commands are used in terminal

 ---- End of Video 20 (The Node Package Manager)

 Command 'npm init' will make package to your project

 Command 'npm install express - save' will put it in package.json as dependency
 With command 'npm uninstall express' we create problem, because it is still in dependencies
 Now command 'npm install' will install all needed files on dependencies

 Nodemon - Package for developing; monitor application files if it changes
 Instillation - 'npm install -g nodemon' // '-g' means it is globally installed (can be used for any application)
 Instead of typing 'node server', you can type 'nodemon server.js'
 You should be able to run it with 'nodemon server.js' but for some security reasons, it does not work..?
 So basically when you change something that runs with nodemon, it would automatically restart due to changes..
